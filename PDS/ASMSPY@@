SPY is a console simulator which works under TSO.
This version of SPY (probably) does not work under later
versions of z/OS.

For a later version of SPY, that works on later z/OS systems,
please use the copy that is on CBT Tape File 566.  That version
works, at least on z/OS 2.5 and probably on 3.1.
